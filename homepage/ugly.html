        <h>Who I am!</h>
        <p>I'm currently a fifth year Computing Science Student at the University of Alberta.</p>

        <h>My Professional History...</h>
        <p>I currently do not have any professional work on my resume.</p>
        <p>However, I am always currently looking for internship positions that will give me practical and meaningful experience. 
            Ideally, I wish to get into the video game industry one day.
        </p>
        <h>What can I do and what do I offer?</h>
        <p>As I've progressed through my undergraduate degree, I've become rather proficient in Python, Javascript and C through coursework and other endeavors.</p>
        <p>If you want to take a look at my developmental work, here is my <a href="https://github.com/OmgPockii">GitHub</a> profile.</p>

        <h>Personal Characteristics!</h>
        <p>I would like to think of myself as a good leader first and foremost--this is resulting 
            from my years of sports experience on top of being a semi-professional gamer at one point. 
            I know what it takes to succeed while motivating and keep others around me engaged and happy.
        </p>
        <p>I'm also an incredible learner both in speed and capability; I love being able to learn about things I am passionate about. 
            I'm not afraid to ask for help or learn from those around me in addition to the aforementioned. 
        </p>
