# Part 1 Changes (Gutenberg)

- Linked CSS file by adding link in all three HTML Files
- Modified cover image links to fit my project directory

- Changed background color to "vintage paper" color and picked a serif font for all body
- Made line spacing (between lines) bigger for paragraphs
- Reduced h1 header tag spacing between letters to make it better suited to my tastes
- Proportionately shrunk the images to take up less page space
- Added border to images

- Note that images for this part were displayed at 67% of the size in Chrome to display more of the page.
